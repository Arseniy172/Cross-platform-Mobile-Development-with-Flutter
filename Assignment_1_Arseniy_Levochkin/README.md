This project is based on a Flutter.

This particular app is created to show jokes and allow user to switch them. This app uses DIO to connect to Chuck Norris API in order to obtain a random joke. Also, it uses a json_serializable for a Joke Model. Every time a user switchs joke, app creates a request to API, after that it obtains a new joke, creates an instance of a Joke Model and shows it on a screen.
